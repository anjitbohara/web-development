              <h3>What I Learnt</h3>
              <p>During this project, I learned the basics of building a website using HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript.</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</strong>HTML is the foundation of every webpage. It’s used to build the structure by adding elements like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. It can be thought of as the skeleton of a webpage, giving it structure and organization.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets):</strong> After building the structure with HTML, CSS is used to make the webpage look nice. It controls the colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. With CSS, I can change how the webpage looks on different devices, such as making sure it fits well on both a big desktop screen and a small mobile phone. This is called responsive design.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>JavaScript:</strong> This is a programming language that I used a little bit in this project. It helps add interactivity to the webpage, like making buttons do something when clicked, or showing pop-up messages. JavaScript can also make the page react to things users do, like clicking, typing, or scrolling.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="text-box">
              <h3>Challenges I Faced</h3>
              <p>During the web development process, I encountered below difficulties:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>CSS Styling and Responsive Design:</strong>I encountered many difficulties with CSS, particularly when working on responsive design. The layout kept breaking on smaller screens, which made the page look inconsistent on mobile devices. Additionally, I faced issues with the grid system in the project gallery, where elements weren’t aligning properly. I also struggled with margins that didn’t behave as expected, and the images of different sizes were causing layout problems.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>JavaScript:</strong>JavaScript was challenging when I was working on the hamburger/responsive mobile menu. The first issue I encountered was getting the menu to toggle open and closed correctly. Once that was resolved, another problem arose: the menu wouldn’t close when I clicked on certain menu items.
                </li>

              <h3>Use of Generative AI and Others work</h3>
              <p>During web development, I encountered several challenges. While I was able to resolve some issues on my own, for others, I turned to Generative AI and additional resources for help, such as:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>ChatGPT: </strong>With ChatGPT, I received helpful suggestions for making my CSS responsive and fixing layout problems, such as the grid system not aligning properly on different screen sizes. ChatGPT also helped me troubleshoot JavaScript issues, particularly with creating the hamburger menu and making it function smoothly across devices. It also helped me solve iframe responsive issue.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>StackOverFlow: </strong>On StackOverflow, I found detailed answers from other developers who had faced similar issues. For example, I found solutions to the problem where my mobile menu wouldn’t close when a menu item was clicked. The discussions on StackOverflow provided practical tips and code snippets that helped me resolve the problem quickly.
